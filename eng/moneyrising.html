   <h1>Money Rising</h1> 
    
<p>For centuries, society has witnessed the absolute power of banks, SWIFT, and financial institutions. They control the flow of money, decide who has access to resources, and set the rules of the economic game. Power radiates from brightly lit trading floors to the skyscrapers of Wall Street and seeps into every ledger, contract, and microtransaction that people take for granted. They are the gatekeepers of the entire financial system, even governments must tread carefully.

<br><br>"But the world is changing, at the right moment and in the right way."

<br><br>A new force rises, not glamorous, without applause, requiring no permission, and exercising no absolute control. This is the “Trident” of the decentralized world: DeFi, Web3, and DAOs. They are not just tools or platforms; they encompass every type of person in society, from engineers, architects, creators, investors to the disillusioned and outliers. They represent a decentralized reality where trust is coded, and power is distributed.

<br><br>While banks operate on a fragmented, slow machine, holding hundreds of trillions of dollars, DeFi is built from billions of lines of code. Data is encrypted from the very start, transactions are verified by randomly selected validators, and smart contracts form emotionless protocols, with the entire system running automated on-chain.

<br><br>Historically, banks and SWIFT have played a pivotal role in allocating assets and circulating money globally, creating a massive protective layer to ensure every dollar goes the right way. But that layer depends on intermediaries with outdated, manual mechanisms; a single weak point can create global risk. Power here means absolute control and it rests in the hands of a few. The more they control, the more the system becomes overloaded, slow, and vulnerable to future disruption.

<br><br>Compared to DeFi and Web3, banks and SWIFT appear archaic, stuck between the past and the present. The DeFi-led Web3 ecosystem can protect the flow of money instantly by flagging "bad" transactions. Every element on-chain can monitor, verify, reject, or isolate dangerous transactions the moment they appear. Web3 doesn’t rely on centralized data stores (though some still do), so if a protocol fails, the main chain remains protected by its decentralized consensus. Everyone participates directly in safeguarding the network, creating a self-protecting system where asset security no longer depends on a single entity.

<br><br>Security in the decentralized world is no longer the task of one organization; it is the right and responsibility of the entire community. Decentralization sets a completely new standard for the global flow of money, where DAOs and human participation take the central role instead of VCs. Every token, smart contract, and voting decision contributes to an ecosystem full of colors and nuances.

<br><br>Power over money is no longer the privilege of a few; it is the responsibility and opportunity of the collective. It no longer resides in Wall Street skyscrapers with private books, but spreads across an invisible network with public ledgers, rooting authority in community contributions. They are gradually separating from the old system, redefining how humans understand money, value, and power.

<br><br>The question is no longer whether the decentralized world will happen, but how fast it will redefine money, power, value and who will stand firm in this new era. The old power structures can only watch as a new system, led by the community, distributes the value of money transparently, with personal data and trust encoded. We will witness DeFi, Web3, and DAOs growing stronger in the future, contribute to driving new forms of money - the social monies of <a href="https://meow.bio/web4.html" style="color:#ff6600; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">Web4</a>.
