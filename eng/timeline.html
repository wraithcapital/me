    <h1>(LIVE)Timeline</h1>
    
    <p>Everything began when the Internet became an indispensable part of everyone's life...

<br><br>With Web1, we could only read content without interacting, and data and information were still quite raw.

<br><br>Web2 brought a new experience when users could interact, both read and create content (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter). Just like interacting directly with a bank by creating an account, password, OTP, PIN,... but all this data is centralized in large companies. This means that when the servers storing blockchain data are hacked, the hacker can have all user information.

<br><br>Web3 ‚Äì the era of decentralization, where data is distributed and a ledger records all activities publicly on the blockchain. Assets belong to the users, and no one can directly control or seize them.

<br><br>At 16, I heard about Bitcoin, something decentralized and not existing in physical form. I heard that in 2010 a website gave away 5 BTC for free just by verifying a captcha code, lmao. The good news is I didn‚Äôt understand anything about it, it was ridiculous when everyone was talking about ‚Äúdigial-money‚Äù instead of earning "real money". I heard that in 2010 a website gave away 5 BTC for free just by verifying a captcha code ‚Äì quite funny haha.

<br><br>At 18, I had saved some money and started learning about Vietnam stock market, believing it was the best. I delved deeply into accounting and analysis like a professional. When I truly want to understand something, I will soon discover the truth behind it. Honestly, I don‚Äôt want to talk about Vietnam stock market, that says it all. Open an account in the US, and buy valuable things on Nasdaq.

<br><br>At 20, I had grown a little older, seemingly more insightful after many years of doing various jobs, meeting and parting ways with friends who didn‚Äôt share the same interests. This was a volatile year when I returned to Bitcoin, it had reached $800, and people were telling each other to buy Bitcoin. I called it the ‚Äúdumber fool‚Äù theory and continued criticizing its madness.

<br><br>At 22, I was drawn to Ethereum when it reached a peak price of $1300. I began to realize my foolishness with Bitcoin. I went crazy and started exploring the truth behind what everyone called a Ponzi‚Ä¶ Perhaps the Internet Capital Markets were gradually forming at this time. I owned ETH, and the sad truth was I couldn‚Äôt withstand its volatility. I continued making mistakes, ETH has sent people like me to the grave.

<br><br>At 24, Solana had a very impressive launch, and I was completely convinced by its founder, Anatoly Yakovenko. I began to study Solana in depth and realized it was something slightly different from Bitcoin and Ethereum.

<br><br>Bitcoin with the highest decentralization network
<br>Ethereum with maximum security layer
<br>Solana providing scalability with the highest performance

<br><br>At 26, I had a stable job with a relatively good salary. And the nightmare began.

<br><br>The market had collapsed at that time, a chain of events falling like dominoes: Luna/UST was a $100 billion Ponzi bomb, FTX went bankrupt due to 3AC and Alameda, everyone panicked and withdrew funds from the lending platform Celsius causing stETH to depeg, ETH and XRP were sued by the SEC for ‚Äúunregistered securities issuance‚Äù, CZ-Binance was arrested and indirectly linked to FTX collapse. Solana dropped 97% in value (~$8/SOL), and everyone said this was the end of cryptocurrency.

<br><br>I started to feel mentally exhausted and temporarily stopped trading like a gambler. Perhaps I had fought too many years and was worn out.

<br><br>Pausing trading in a bear market allowed me to truly learn about Web3, blockchain, and everything instead of chasing endless buy-sell and pump-dump trades. The loss I incurred was -70% NAV. Few people can get through this phase, most are just bluffers.

<br><br>At 28, I heard that some liquidity aggregator was about to airdrop to all users on Solana. The chaos of wild cats shook the entire space.

<br><br>üí•Boommmm, Jupiter Exchange brought all Solana users back from the dead with the largest airdrop ever. This airdrop erased my previous -70% NAV loss. To this day, I haven‚Äôt sold even a cent.

<br><br>After the FTX incident, many users on Solana cried, all their assets were isolated by Sam Bankman-Fried and at risk of total loss. Jupiter, Meteora, Bonk, and Pumpfun appeared with the mission to patch Solana ecosystems. The wilderness was revived strongly, Solana returned to $300, far beyond many people‚Äôs imagination.

<br><br>I will talk more about Jupiter co-founder in another article, he is one of the strangest people I have ever met.

<br><br>At 30, the world has changed a lot...

<br><br>(to be continued)
