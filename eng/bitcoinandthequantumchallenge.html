   <h1>Bitcoin and the Quantum challenge</h1> 
    
<p>For many years, <a href="https://wraithcapital.github.io/me/eng/bitcoinandthequantumchallenge.html" style="color:#f7931a; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> has been regarded as the unassailable fortress of the cryptocurrency world. This trust rests largely on the strength of elliptic curve cryptography, which is robust enough to withstand any attack from classical computers. Yet, the rise of quantum computing has cast a shadow of doubt: if one day quantum machines become powerful enough, will Bitcoin’s security foundation remain intact?

<br><br>In theory, quantum computers equipped with algorithms such as Shor’s could solve the discrete logarithm problem - the basis of Bitcoin’s digital signatures in a fraction of the time. This would mean that an attacker could derive private keys from public keys, turning what was once considered “immutable” into something fragile. For now, quantum technology is still far from reaching that point. The threat is not immediate, but it cannot be dismissed, as history shows that technological breakthroughs often arrive faster and more unexpectedly than anticipated.

<br><br>That is why the Bitcoin community has already begun to seek solutions. Post-quantum cryptographic schemes, such as Dilithium or Falcon, are being researched and standardized to replace traditional ECDSA. In the future, a soft fork may introduce new address types, allowing users to safeguard their assets with quantum-resistant signatures without disrupting the existing structure of the network. At the same time, the principle of avoiding address reuse continues to be encouraged, as it limits premature exposure of public keys and reduces the risk of “harvest now, decrypt later.”

<br><br>If quantum computing is seen as a test, then it serves to reaffirm Bitcoin’s resilience. A truly immutable system is not one that remains static, but one that adapts in order to preserve its core value through every upheaval. Just as Bitcoin has survived countless doubts, challenges, and crises in its history, the quantum threat may ultimately prove to be only another chapter—one in which Bitcoin once again demonstrates its enduring strength.
