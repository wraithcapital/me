    <h1>Journey into Web3</h1>

    <p>I grew up with stories about the financial crisis of 2008. People said it was an unprecedented earthquake, when even the largest banks in the world collapsed within days. Deposits, savings accounts, the numbers on the screen that once seemed untouchable suddenly turned into foam, vanishing as collective trust crumbled.

<br><br>Out of those ruins, Bitcoin emerged like a stranger stepping out of the shadows. It had no bank guarantee, no office, no official promise, only a piece of invisible code declaring: “this money belongs to you, and no one can take it away.”

<br><br>By the time I truly touched the digital world, Web2 was at its peak. Facebook was the global square where anyone could speak about anything. YouTube was the stage, Twitter the place where news spread faster than television. I was intoxicated by those endless connections, but then I began to realize a paradox: everything I posted, everything I searched, every trace I left online no longer belonged to me. It was collected, analyzed, packaged into data profiles, and sold to the highest bidder. I thought I was the user, but in fact, I was the product.

<br><br>Massive data breaches only reinforced that truth. Every time millions of accounts were stolen, I asked myself: why is the privacy of a human being so cheap? Why is my value measured in clicks and interactions? Web2 gave us cities lit up with dazzling lights, but at the same time chained us under thousands of cameras, where every small move was recorded to feed the advertising machine.

<br><br>And then Web3 appeared, with hundreds of projects sprouting up, both good and bad. It was not a sweet promise but a wild frontier. There were no fences, no guards, only people hungry for freedom building tents, lighting fires, and rewriting the rules.

<br><br>At first, I was skeptical and believed it was nothing more than a haven for criminals. Words like Blockchain, smart contract, NFT, DeFi, Metaverse, GameFi,... They all sounded like a foreign language understood only by eccentrics. But the deeper I went, the more fascinated I became. Not because tokens could skyrocket in hours, but because for the first time my data, my assets, were no longer trapped in someone else’s server. Web3 had scattered them across hundreds of thousands of nodes. A long string of characters, the private key became the only border between me and complete loss. The risks were real, but so was ownership.

<br><br>Web3 is not rosy. It is full of scams, ghost projects, opportunists waiting to drain the naïve. I lost money, I grew tired, I stared at the sea of red numbers on my screen and cursed my own foolishness. Yet strangely, within that chaos I felt a vitality like never before. In a place where rules are still being written every day, I saw a community experimenting together, failing together, and then rising again to build. They are the OGs, the first generation who shaped the Web3 we see today.
<br><br>If Web2 is a world of convenient control, where you are connected but constantly monitored, then Web3 is the wild land of freedom. It is dangerous, harsh, and not for the faint of heart. You must learn everything; you cannot afford “gaps” in your survival knowledge of Web3.

<br><br>Just like the Wild West in history, it is that very ferocity that creates legends. In the mix of fear and allure, I realized Web3 is not only about the future of privacy. It is a grand experiment in trust, ownership, and freedom for humankind in the digital age.

<br><br>Start understanding Web3 now, because the world is changing while we sleep.
