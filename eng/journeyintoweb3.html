    <h1>Journey into Web3</h1>
    
</body>
</html>
    <p>Everything began when the Internet became an inseparable part of daily life. 

<br><br>"With Web1, we could only read content without interacting, and data was still raw and limited
  
<br><br>Web2 brought a new experience, where users could interact, both reading and creating content (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter,...). It also allowed us to interact directly with banks by creating accounts, passwords, OTPs, and PIN codes… but all of this data was centralized in the hands of large corporations. This meant that if the servers storing blockchain-related data were hacked, attackers could access everything about the users.

<br><br>Web3 marks the era of decentralization, where data is distributed and every activity is recorded transparently on the blockchain. Assets truly belong to the users, beyond the control or direct seizure of any single authority."

<br><br>At 16, I first heard about Bitcoin, something decentralized and intangible. Then, some guy gave me 5 BTC as a keepsake, but I treated it like a joke. I didn’t even bother to save the 12 recovery words. The funny thing is, I had absolutely no idea what it was. It felt ridiculous that people were talking about “virtual money” instead of focusing on “real money”. Believe it or not, there was even a website giving away 5 BTC just for solving a captcha, haha.

<br><br>By 18, I had saved some money and started studying Vietnam stock market. I dove deep into accounting practices and analysis like a professional. When I genuinely want to understand something, I switch into god-mode, you wouldn’t believe your eyes. Honestly, I don’t want to talk much about Vietnam stock market. Just don’t join it - 90% of companies hide profits, book losses, and funnel earnings into subsidiaries. Instead, open a brokerage account in the U.S. and buy valuable assets on Nasdaq.

<br><br>At 20, I was a little older and perhaps more thoughtful after years of working countless jobs and meeting, then parting with people who didn’t share my interests. This was the year Bitcoin came back into my life, having reached $800. Everyone around me was rushing to buy. I called it the “greater fool theory” and kept criticizing the madness.

<br><br>At 22, I was captivated by Ethereum when it hit $1,300. That’s when I realized how foolish I had been about Bitcoin. I went crazy, diving into the truth behind what people called a Ponzi scheme. Maybe the Internet Capital Markets were already taking shape at that moment. I held Ethereum, but sadly, I couldn’t handle its volatility and made yet another mistake.
      
<br><br>At 24, Solana launched with an impressive debut. I was completely convinced by its founder - Anatoly Yakovenko. I studied everything about Solana and realized it was something slightly different from Bitcoin and Ethereum. It was also the moment I understood the so-called blockchain trilemma - the impossibility of achieving decentralization, security, and scalability all at once. Yet here were 3 blockchains, each excelling in one domain, destined to coexist within a much larger network than we could imagine.

<br><br>Bitcoin, the most decentralized network.
<br>Ethereum, with the highest level of security.
<br>Solana, delivering scalability with unmatched performance.

<br><br>At 26, I had a stable job with a decent salary. But I grew mentally exhausted and paused trading like a gambler who had played for too many years.

<br><br>The market had collapsed: FTX imploded alongside 3AC and Alameda, Celsius caused stETH to depeg, Luna/UST turned out to be a Ponzi, CZ (Binance) got arrested… everyone was saying this was the end of crypto

<br><br>It was also the first time I truly stopped trading and started learning about Web3, about blockchain, about everything beyond the endless cycle of buying, selling, pumping, and dumping. My realized loss was -70% NAV. Few could survive that stage; most were just loudmouths pretending otherwise.

<br><br>At 28, Jupiter resurrected an entire user base with the largest airdrop Solana had ever seen. Somehow, this airdrop allowed me to recover my -70% NAV loss. To this day, I haven’t sold a single cent. I’ll write more about Jupiter co-founder another time, he’s one of the strangest people I’ve ever encountered.
  
<br><br>Now at 30, the game is about to begin...
