    <h1>Banks and the DeFi nightmare</h1>
    
<p>Banks once basked in the glow of absolute power. They were at the center of every transaction, acting as gatekeepers and channeling the flow of money alongside institutions, determining who could step into the financial world and who would be left behind. Thick stone walls, rigid regulations, and ledgers stacked with debts had long placed them at the top of society’s hierarchy.

<br><br>But then, the nightmare called DeFi came crashing in, inheriting Satoshi will. They arrived without asking for permission, didn’t wait for approval, and certainly wasn’t born from any bank’s blueprint. It emerged as an entirely new infrastructure, beyond their reach. Suddenly, users held the keys to their own wallets. Assets were no longer confined within centralized ledgers but flowed freely, fragmented and secured across hundreds of thousands of independent nodes. A smart contract could replace an entire lending department; a blockchain could rival the entire machinery of international money transfers. No intermediaries, no waiting.

<br><br>In boardrooms lit by fluorescent light, fear began to creep in. Banks realized they no longer held absolute control. DeFi had transformed services that once generated enormous profits: lending, borrowing, liquidity, trading,... into lines of public code. NFTs and Metaverse birthed new markets where assets lacked physical form yet rivaled or even surpassed the value of real-world property. And most terrifying of all: 

<br><br>"All of this unfolded without them."

<br><br>Yet banks did not collapse. They survived, they endured, but they were no longer at the center of the financial universe. Instead, they are pushed to the end of the flow, becoming the final "cash-out" point, where those exiting the decentralized world are forced to convert back to fiat. From once commanding the throne, banks now resemble the backdoor of a brightly lit building, where people come and go, treating them only as a temporary stop.

<br><br>The Web3 network with the sheer power of DeFi, has rendered banks and traditional institutions obsolete. After 2020, they seemed to realize something: BlackRock, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, Robinhood, and even entire nations began to take part… Wall Street started to shake, and they quickly adopted so-called ETFs. At their core, these ETFs are merely a façade of the old model—they still hold the keys to unlocking trillions of dollars. And unfortunately, their clients are holding worthless pieces of paper without even realizing it.

<br><br>"Could the role of traditional banks be pushed to the end of the value chain?"

<br><br>They may still manage numbers within the old system, but they no longer manage trust. And trust is the most valuable currency in any financial system.

<br><br>Web3 did not kill banks, but it stripped them of their crown. Banks have been pushed into the role of serving, rather than leading. Web3 proved that power does not lie in skyscrapers of glass and steel, but in open code, transparency, and the hands of millions who choose freedom.

<br><br>Banks still breathe, but the throne is no longer theirs. And once the flow of money has shifted, no dam will ever be strong enough to hold it back.
