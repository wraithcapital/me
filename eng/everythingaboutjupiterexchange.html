    <h1>Everything about Jupiter Exchange</h1>
    
<p><a href="https://jup.ag" style="color:#ff6600; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">Jupiter Exchange</a> is one of the core products of the Solana ecosystem, often described as the “gateway” that allows users to access the network full liquidity.

<br><br>Starting with a team of 15 anonymous individuals, Jupiter at that time was merely a transaction routing tool (AMM aggregator). Up to now, Jupiter has grown into a multi-billion-dollar entity, generating sustainable revenue and serving over 2 million users. It is one of the most prominent and influential names in the Solana ecosystem, not only because of its scale but also due to the way it shapes the decentralized trading experience. Its strength lies not only in its ability to connect to dozens of liquidity sources but also in providing smooth, intuitive, and cost-efficient experiences for users.

<br><br>Jupiter name gained even more recognition after a historic airdrop. This event left a significant mark, both rewarding loyal users and expanding Jupiter influence across the market.

<br><br>Not stopping at token swaps like in its early days, Jupiter launched the upgraded Jup Pro with more professional features: from gasless swaps, limit orders, DCA, recurring orders, trigger orders to core products such as lending/borrowing (Lend), Launchpad for creators (Studio), JUP mobile app (iOS/Android), Portfolio tracker for all Solana wallet assets, and Perpetual (JLP Pool).

<br><br>In 2024, they spent hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire 5 key names: Ultimate Wallet, Coinhall, SolanaFM, SonarWatch, and a majority stake in Moonshot. They decided to use capital to quickly secure the missing pieces rather than spending a long time building them from zero.

<br><br>“DeFi doesn’t wait.”

<br><br>At the Jupuary 2025 event, <a href="https://meow.bio" style="color:#ff6600; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">@weremeow</a> (co-founder of Jupiter) revealed the Jupnet plan. The subsequent crucial vote caused much controversy but was ultimately approved.

<br><br>Currently, they have assembled a team of top engineers in the industry, aligned with their strategic future direction. More than 80 people together are building a groundbreaking product that could change how people interact with DeFi: “Jupnet and the vision of unified omnichain liquidity <a href="https://meow.bio/gum.html" style="color:#ff6600; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">(Giant Unified Market)</a>.”

<br><br>This rapid development shows that Jupiter does not merely aim to be a simple liquidity aggregator on Solana but also seeks to expand its presence to other chains and become an Omnichain trading hub.

<br><br>Overall, Jupiter brings a fresh breeze to DeFi on Solana. It not only provides users with more options but also reshapes the way people access decentralized finance. It represents a combination of efficiency, transparency, and community strength, becoming a clear example that DeFi can move closer to traditional financial experiences while retaining its open and decentralized spirit.
